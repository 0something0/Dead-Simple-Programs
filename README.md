# Dead Simple Programs
Various minimal viable programs, in various languages

Even simple programs like GNU Nano or Vi still consist of thousands of lines of code. What if we went even lower?

### This is not (necessarily):

...a code golfing repo. Simplification and reduction of code is a priority, but hacks shouldn't be used at the cost of readability. 

...Suckless. While this repo takes inspiration from the Suckless philosophy, its by no means an adherent. Security, readability, and maintainability should be prioritized over speed. Programs should be usable by a wide range of people, rather than a small, elitist group.

…low level, particularly as I’m coming from a Java and Python background. I do have my eyes set on the newfangled low level languages like Rust or Go though, that doesn’t mean I’ll be able to produce….

…good code, for low level languages that may be added.
